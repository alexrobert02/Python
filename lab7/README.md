# Lab 7

1. Create a package that reads CSV files and validates their contents based on user-defined rules (e.g., checking for missing values, ensuring data types are correct).


2. Design a package that provides functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and can handle both integers and floating-point numbers.


3. Create a package that merges multiple text files into one. It should allow users to specify the order of files and add custom separators between file contents.


4. Develop a package that generates random, secure passwords. Users should be able to specify the length and whether to include special characters, numbers, and mixed case letters.
